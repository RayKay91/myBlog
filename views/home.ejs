            Hi! ðŸ‘‹. This is a public blog where you can write a post and view it! It has data persistence as the posts are saved to a database in the cloud using <strong>MongoDB</strong>. This website was made using <strong>express</strong> to handle routing, <strong>mongoose</strong> to handle the database CRUD ops and <strong>EJS</strong> as a templating system.
          </p>
